    "<blockquote> Environmental data is extremely rich, encompassing both real-time data from sensors and monthly or yearly manually collected samples. In my opinion, not all this data is currently being utilized to its full potential. For instance, when I was working on my bachelor thesis, I developed a quantitative approach to depict the environmental health conditions of 5 Rural Areas on Java Island. I utilized various environmental data sets, including Air Quality, Water Quality, Biodiversity Index, Forest Cover, Environmental Health, and Public Health. At that time, lacking prior knowledge in data science, I merely processed the data only to understand the current conditions. However, it's worth noting that we have the capability to translate this data \n",
